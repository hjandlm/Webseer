# ✨Webseer✨

_Webseer — Not everything is worth crawling._


</div>

---

**Webseer** is a semantic web intelligence agent that collects and structures relevant online information based on a user-defined focus.  
Unlike traditional crawlers, **Webseer navigates the web with intent, understanding content and following meaning rather than blindly scraping links.**

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **User-Guided Focus**: Start with a topic or question — Webseer builds a knowledge path around it.
- **Semantic Content Discovery**: Automatically identifies meaningful blocks on a page (not just raw HTML).
- **Smart Link Expansion**: Selectively follows related links based on semantic relevance, not just structure.
- **Recursive Exploration**: Builds a web of related insights from multiple layers of content.


## 🧠 What Makes It Different?

> Traditional scrapers crawl everything. **Webseer** understands what’s worth collecting.

It acts more like a research assistant than a bot — performing **contextual search**, **information distillation**, and **structured discovery**.

## ✨ Name Meaning

> Webseer = Web + Seer (a person who sees deeply and reveals hidden truths)

The name reflects its mission: uncovering meaningful information through intelligent exploration, not brute-force crawling.
